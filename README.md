In this project I will be creating a Bingo Game! This game will be fun interactive for users to experience their favorite childhood game Bingo. This game will not alter change any game rules from the original content creators. Not changing any of the game rules will allow the game to be user friendly and easily interactive to play. Bingo has many different versions. In my interactive game, we will reference the American version of the game. Bingo is fun, because Bingo is a betting game a game that will test your Chance. Bingo is always fun because the game is designed for it to be random. Typically, in a game of Bingo is played in person. The person that orchestrates the game typically draws a number and the players match the number on their cards to the random ball selection that gets pulled by the individual orchestrating the game. Since there is typically a person that is orchestrating the game pulling the random ball selection, they are the person that operates the device. No devices can be used for an online interactive game. So, this game will be created where the computer is the device pulling the random numbers, and the computer, phone or tablet to access the internet is the only device needed for the players can mark off their cards if their number is drawn.  

 
 

In order to create an interactive game that is easily accessible to online users we first have to think about the |Game Rules| and how the game is played. Simply following basic rules and guidelines can help create the game easier and faster. Not alternating and changing the rules will help the game be created easier and faster.  

 
 

Since Bingo is not a game of skill (a game that is designed by your mental, and/or physical) but more designed to be a game of chance. The outcome will always be what the computer generates. This gives every user a chance to eventually win. This is what makes Bingo fun. Every player has a chance to win. A player may win 1...2...3...or even 4 games in a row but game of chance can always create losers. There is no degree of skill to play this game. This is what creates the excitement to play the game.  

 
 

Secondly, we think mainly of what do we need to play the game of Bingo. Many games have equipment to play the game rather its cards, a board, a tool etc. Luckily online we only have to create a structure of the game so users can utilize the online features of the game. Thats the benefit of creating games online, users don't have to go out to purchase any additional devices to pay the game. Now many online games do have additional features, where Users can purchase additional features to enhance their game experience. But creating an online Bingo Game can be done for free. Since this is my first creation of a big game, we will keep it simple for Users. Good thing is we can always go back and do upgrades if we ever want to offer our games to companies, online active play, etc.  

 
 

So, let's think of what do we need to build our structure of the game. I believe we mentioned first step is to review the game rules. So, let's take a look on How to Play BINGO, so we can start building our online game. Since our game is online and we agreed that we will not offer additional purchase features we will include all devices for the user for **FREE!** So let's focus on the rules of the **Game.**

 # ***Lets Get ready to Alter our Game and Compare it to Rules we found***

 These rules were generated from WiKIHow.com. I will show you how I will alter each section to benefit an online game!

1. **Get at least 1 scorecard for each player**

* In this game creation computer will select a random selection of cards. Each time player plays computer will generate a new card for Player/User. Since I am the one creating the game I will make a replica of already generated cards. Overall plan is to tackle how to create  code for the card selection to alter between different cards

2. **Explain to everyone how the game's letter-number combinations work.**

* My main goal for this section is to have a rules section that states the rules of the game. I believe since the game is online and  there is no-one orchestrating the game. We can only tell users certain aspects about the game by clicking on additional links or being informative as possible. 

2. **Choose a player to be the caller.** 

* No player will be the caller of the game. Since the game is online the computer will have to be the caller. Computer will make all random selections of the game and call out the numbers of the ball. 

3. **Give each player a pile of Bingo chips**

* Since the game is online there will be no chips. What way can we make our game have markers for the players? How will the computer or user mark the section or ball thats being called?

4. **Place a chip on the square in the center of your scorecard.**

* In Bingo, the square in the center of everyone's scorecard is considered a free space. Everyone starts out with 1 chip over that space. It will make since to create every one of the BINGO cards with a free space thats inluded. 


5. **Give the caller the letters and numbers they'll call out in the game.**

* This section portion may be used in the online game. 

6. **Have the caller read out a letter-number combination.**

* We have to think, in my game how will the computer shout out or alert the player that a particular ball is being selected. 

7. **Place a chip on your scorecard if you have that letter and number.**

* In my game will I have either/or. Will I have the computer auto-generate and mark the card if the ball number is being called. Or will the user have the choice to mark their own card. I will more than likely go with the option where the User can mark their card with the ball thats being called. 

8. **Continue playing until someone gets 5 chips in a row on their scorecard.**

* When my users are playing I want a cool way for them to win. Maybe they get coins or fake confetti. Either way noone likes playing a game with no reward. So i want my game to generate a rewards system where instead or score they get coins or a ***YAY, You WON!*** I want to think of why this benefits the User. 

9. **Shout "Bingo" if you get 5 squares in a row.**

* Since we are creating an online game the computer needs someway of knowing that you haves scored Bingo. I was thiking of using the coding system if/then statements to accomplish this goal. 

10. **Have everyone clear their scorecards after someone wins.**

* For my game I am thinking how will the computer know that 1. The game has been won? 2. What interactive setting will be used for the computer to know to generate a new card. 

11. **Mix up all the letter-number combinations for the next game.**

* I was thinking of how I can tell my game to react of hey this game is over. Its time for a **NEW** Game.

# **Last thing Lets Play Other Online Bingo Games to See What Our Game Maybe Missing!**

***This May alter the way we create our game by enjoying other interactive experiences from other game creators to see what we like and what we dont like. This will help to know what I will and will not ue in my own game creation.***
